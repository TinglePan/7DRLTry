Day0:
Played Enshrouded too much to forget the jam's entry deadline. Gonna try develop anyway. By the way, anyone knows who designed maps in Enshrouded? He's really a genuis at hiding treasure chests. I'd like to follow him on tweeter.

Day1:
Plan to do: Character control. Map. Enemies. As simple as possible. I plan to make the map small and with no initial terrains just like Brotato, so I do not have to code complex mapgen. Enemies spawn at map edges and chase the player in melee.
Actually did: Basic character control. A plain map. Stub enemies with only placeholder sprite and nothing else. Simply place these enemies on map edges by time randomly.

Day2:
Plan to do: Add control panel, the core of the game. It is a grid of cells, containing unit tiles. Units provides functionality. Some units are directional. The control panel should be able to rotate. Messing around with the control panel should be like layout management. I wish I could add those fancy things that appeals me in layout management, such as chemical reactions, pipelines, tower defense, or Luck be a Landlord things? But I won't have that time to do all those things. So drag and drop cells first. Then add a similar backpack panel to hold units that can be placed into the control panel. Maybe i will focus on tower defense this time.
